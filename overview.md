## My Grandmother's Scrapbook Recipes
***
My Grandmother taught me that food is love.  Her name is Julie (Julia).  She showed her love to our family by cooking wonderful meals and desserts.  

In her kitchen was a sideboard.  On the top of that sideboard always sat two ring binders.  Let's call them old and older.  These binders were scrapbooks where she stashed recipes and newspaper and magazine clippings about food.

I now have these two binders.  I had them sitting in a box in a corner of my bedroom for it seems like a decade.  Before that, my syster had them.  Well, now I want to share parts of what my Grandmother collected.

This will be a very slow work in progress.  I plan try any recipe before I share it.  Just stay tuned and check back from time to time.

Enjoy.  I hope you give one of these recipes a try.  Share it with someone you love.
