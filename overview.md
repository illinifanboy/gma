## My Grandmother's Scrapbook Recipes
***
My Grandmother taught me that food is love.  Her name is Julie (Julia).  She showed her love to our family by cooking wonderful meals and desserts.  

In her kitchen was a sideboard.  On the top of that sideboard always sat two ring binders.  Let's call them old and older.  These binders were scrapbooks where she stashed recipes and newspaper and magazine clippings about food.

I now have these two binders.  I had them sitting in a box in a corner of my bedroom for it seems like a decade.  Before that, my syster had them.  Well, now I want to share parts of what my Grandmother collected.

This will be a slow and incremental process. 
Just stay tuned and check in from time to time.  I'll be adding content semi-regularly.

Enjoy.  I hope you give one of these recipes a try.  Share it with someone you love.

### How Old Are These Recipes?

I found this clip concerning Inger Stevens.  It was on the backside of a recipe clip.  It says she is "a surprise success in her first Hollywood starring role."  Imdb says "Inger made her film debut at age 22 opposite Bing Crosby in Man on Fire (1957)."  So, at least one of these clippings is from the 1950's.
