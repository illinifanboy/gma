### Steve's Review  
It's a good tasting chocolate frosting.  This frosting has a different texture than your run-of-the-mill buttercream.  It's cooked from normal sugar.  It almost pours on and creates a shiny coat.  It is a little liquid.  That must be why it is meant for sheet cakes.  This recipe makes an okay thickness of frosting once spread.  I may double the recipe next time.    

### Grandma's Handwritten Recipe

I wish I could tell stories about how my Grandmother served us this recipe, but I can't.  Her dessert choices tended toward pies, cookies, and cheesecake.  She didn't make cakes, so I don't remember her serving us this cake frosting.
